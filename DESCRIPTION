Description: Offers a handful of useful wrapper functions which can be used
	to quickly and interactively visualize and filter SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism)
	datasets. This R-based implementation of SNP and genotype filters facilitates a
	an interactive and iterative SNP filtering pipeline, which can be easily and 
	reproducibly documented via Rmarkdown. This Rmarkdown report can then serve as
	stable and data-rich documentation of the
	SNP filtering parameters explored and implemented for your given dataset.
	All functions take 'vcfR' objects as input, which can easily be
	generated by reading standard vcf (variant call format) files into R using 
	the R package vcfR (Knaus and Gr√ºnwald) (<doi:10.1111/1755-0998.12549>). 
	Each function returns a newly filtered vcfR object, which can be
	written in standard vcf output using the vcfR package, for downstream population
	genetic and phylogenetic analyses.
