Description: Offers a handful of useful wrapper functions which can be used
	to visualize parameter space and filter vcf (variant call format) files,
	allowing users to quickly and interactively explore the downstream
	implications of filtering decisions on SNP datasets. R-based 
	implementation of these SNP and genotype filters facilitates the
	generation of reproducible and informative 'SNP filtering reports' via
	Rmarkdown, which can serve as stable and data-rich documentation of the
	SNP filtering parameters explored and implemented for a next-gen dataset.
	All functions take 'vcfR' objects as input, which can easily be
	generated by reading a vcf file into R using the R package vcfR 
	(Knaus and Gr√ºnwald) (<doi:10.1111/1755-0998.12549>). Similarly,
	each function returns a newly filtered vcfR object, which can be
	written in standard vcf output using the function vcfR::write.vcf().
