\title{Remove SNPs with more than two alleles}
\usage{
filter_biallelic(vcfR)
}
\arguments{
\item{vcfR}{a vcfR object}
}
\value{
a vcfR object with SNPs containing more than two alleles removed
}
\description{
This function simply removes any SNPs from the vcf file which contains more than
two alleles. Many downstream applications require
SNPs to be biallelic, so this filter is generally a good idea during processing.
